# About Us

The main goal of the neurovascular team is to:

* Model and understand the bi-directional neurovascular system and study the effect of such coupling on neural activity and plasticity using artificial neural networks.
* Develop a network level model to capture neuro-glial-vascular interaction with a simplified computational model
* Reframe neurovascular coupling in terms of demand of energy and its efficient distribution.

# Vision

Develop a simple yet powerful model to implement neurovascular coupling in theÂ [MESOBRAIN project](https://biotech.iitm.ac.in/Faculty/CNS_LAB/home.html).
